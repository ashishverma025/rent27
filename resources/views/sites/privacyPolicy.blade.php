<b>HOURS of SERVICE and DRIVER’s DAILY LOG </b>
 <br><br><br>
All drivers are expected to operate within the laws set forth by the DOT. A brief explanation of those laws is set forth below.
 <b>14 Hour Rule:</b>
  <br><br><br>
   This rule requires drivers to stop 14 hours after beginning their duty tour. Regardless of how the time is spent, the driver must take a 10-hour break at the end of 14 hours. The 14 hours period begins once the driver ends his 10-hour break by making an entry line 4, on duty, or line 3, driving. Empty Truck 100 as a third party rely on the corporation of both driver and company rules to provide the best service to its client, but is not responsible for any decision between driver and company. 
  <br><br><br>
   <b>11 Hour Rule:</b>
Within the 14 hours allowed to the driver, only 11 of those hours may be spent on line 3, driving. Once the driver has had 11 hours of driving time, he must take a 10-hour break before driving, even if he has time left in his 14-hour period. Empty Truck 100 as a third party rely on the corporation of both driver and company rules to provide the best service to its client.  
 <br><br><br>
 <b>70 hours Rule:</b>
  <br><br><br>
  This rule states that once you have been working for 70 hours in any 8- day period, you may not drive. In order to comply with this regulation, you need to keep track of your hours. Each day, before you begin driving, you need to add up your total hours on lines 3 and 4 for the past 7 days and subtract the answer from 70. Whatever is left is what you can drive that day. The 70 hours of accumulated time may be eliminated by taking 34 consecutive hours off duty. If the driver has 34 consecutive hours off, his 70 hour total is reduced to 0 and he begins the cycle again. Empty Truck 100 as a third party rely on the corporation of both driver and company rules to provide the best service to its client, but is not responsible for any decision between driver and company
  <br><br><br>
  <b>10 Hour Break:</b>
  <br><br><br>
  All decisions are made by the Trucking Company. Empty Truck 100 as a third party rely on the corporation of both driver and company rules to provide the best service to its client. Breaks must be taken in the sleeper berth or off duty. If sleeping in a sleeper berth equipped truck, the time should be logged on line 2, Sleeper berth. Off duty time spent outside of the sleeper should be logged on line 1, Off Duty. If the 10 hour break is uninterrupted by any on duty or driving time, you may combine line 1 and line 2 to achieve your 10 hours.
    <br><br><br>
	
<b>Speed:</b>
    <br><br><br>
DOT requires that all trucks abide by the speed limits of the states that they are operating in. They also state that in their opinion, if a truck obeys the law, it cannot average more than 5mph less than the speed limit. In the case of 2 lane highways with a 55mph speed limit, DOT believes that the maximum that a truck can average is 45mph. Be sure that your average speeds for the trip do not exceed these maximums. In protecting a good business relationship, Empty Truck 100 recommend that all DOT requires must be honored.
    <br><br><br>
<b>On Duty Time:</b>
 <br><br><br>
All fuel stops, DOT inspections, random drug tests, time spent loading/unloading, breakdowns, vehicle inspections, and accidents must be unloading time should reflect only the time that is spent actually working. Time spent waiting, etc, may be logged off duty or in the sleeper berth Timely submission: Logs should be turned in as soon after completion as possible. Ideally, all logs should be turned in every time that the truck returns to the terminal. At the very most, DOT requires that the logs be turned in not more than 13 days from the date of completion. Empty Truck 100 is in agreement but does not make decision regarding the above.
 <br><br><br>
<b>Falsification:</b>
<br><br><br>
Empty Truck recommend that Logs must match all timed and dated documents including fuel stops, road side inspections, toll tickets, Kat Scale tickets, and freight bills. Mileage must be at least the miles listed by Household movers guide. Point to point miles should match as well as total miles for the trip. Empty Truck 100 again is not responsible for decision made regarding the above.
<br><br><br>
<b>SAFETY</b>
<br><br><br>
Empty Truck 100 is in agreement that all drivers are expected to operate in a safe and defensive manner at all times, although not responsible for any loss or accident by the driver of the Trucking Company. More than one at fault accident in a three-year period will result in the driver’s safety clearance being revoked.
<br><br><br>
<b>Speed:</b>
<br><br><br>
<br><br><br>
EmptyTruck100 recommend and it is expected that all drivers operate within the posted speed limits for the states that they are operating in. Excessive tickets will result in the driver being put on probation or terminated.
<br><br><br>
<b>Following distances:</b>
<br><br><br>
EmptyTruck100 believe in safety and recommend that all drivers are expected to use the National Safety Council’s following rule. This requires a minimum of 7 seconds of following distance at highway speeds and 6 seconds at speeds under 40mph. These following distances should be increased by at least 1 second if the roads are wet or slick.
<br><br><br>
<b>Reduced Traction:</b>
<br><br><br>
Adverse weather conditions can result in reduced traction. In the event of rain, reduce your speed by 25-30% and increase your following distance by at least 1 second. If the rain is heavy enough to require your wipers to be operated on high, or if your visibility is reduced by tire spray, speeds may need to be decreased even further and following distances increased. When operating on snow covered highways, speeds should be decreased by at least 50% and following distances should be increased by at least 2 seconds. This rule applies even if the snow cover on the highway is intermittent. Remember, there may well be icy conditions as a result of snow being compressed by traffic. When operating on icy roads, the best recommendation is “don’t.” When conditions become icy, find a safe haven and get off the road. Until you can do this, reduce your speed to a crawl, use your 4-ways, and increase your following distances by at least 2-3 seconds. Remember, ice at 32 degrees can be up to 10 times as slick as ice at 0 degrees. This means that your stopping distances can increase by a factor of 10. (As a example, on wet ice, stopping distances at 30 miles per hour can increase from a normal distance of 100 ft to as much as 800-900 ft.) This is highly recommended to protect both Empty Truck 100 and Trucking Company.
<br><br><br>
<b>Reduced visibility:</b>
<br><br><br>
Conditions such as snow, fog, heavy rain, dust, and smoke can result in reduced visibility. The rule for such conditions is to reduce your speed so that you can stop within your window of visibility. If such a speed reduction creates a hazard of being rear ended, use your 4-way flashers, stay to the right, and find a safe place to exit the highway and park as soon as possible. As a rule of thumb, make sure that you can see at least 8-10 seconds ahead of your vehicle. This gives you the opportunity to see hazards, process the information, and react without an emergency lock-up that increases the risk someone rear-ending you. Empty Truck 100 will take no responsibilities for any accident, you must abide by the TOD laws and regulations.
<br><br><br>
<b>Courtesy:</b>
<br><br><br>
All drivers are expected to operate in a safe and courteous manner at all times. This is the key to defensive driving, and it doesn’t cost you anything to be courteous to other traffic.
<br><br><br>
<b>Time management:</b>
<br><br><br>
While it is the trucking company responsibility to make sure their employee comply by all their rules, Empty Truck 100 is not responsible for any decision made with regards to employee time management. One of the biggest problems that drivers have is time management. Too often, drivers wait until the last minute to leave home or the terminal. Or, a driver who does leave in a timely manner will spend too much time at the truck stop drinking coffee or playing video games instead of heading down the road. In either case, the driver is now on a tight schedule. Any minor delay along the route will cause a late delivery or will cause the driver to feel “pushed for time”. This usually results in speeding, discourtesy, and excessive fatigue on the part of the driver. Schedule yourself properly and watch your time. Don’t create emergencies through poor time management. Empty Truck 100 will make every effort to protect their client.
<br><br><br>
<b>Backing:</b>
<br><br><br>

As a third party, EmptyTruck100 will be your liaison between the trucking company and customer. Therefore, all instructions will be given and follow up by the trucking company.
<br><br><br>

<b>Inspections:</b>
<br><br><br>
Don’t wait until the truck breaks down to find the problem. DOT and the company both require that you do a thorough pre-trip and post-trip inspection on your vehicle. As you do your walk around, be sure to take a rag with you and wipe off your reflective striping, reflectors, lights, and mirrors. This is to ensure that Empty Truck 100 offers the best service to their client.
<br><br><br>
<b>Emergency breakdowns:</b>
<br><br><br>
If for some reason, you are required to stop on the side of the road for emergency reasons, put out your triangles. Be sure that they are far enough behind your truck to warn oncoming motorists and to meet the requirements found in part 392 of motor carrier regulations. GENERAL INFORMATION Roadside. It is your responsibility to inform your company employer of any incidents. Empty Truck 100 is not responsible for any such issues.
<br><br><br>
<b>Inspections:</b>
<br><br><br>
All roadside inspections must be turned into the company as soon as possible. If you or your truck are placed out of service, call your dispatcher immediately. Remember, it is your responsibility to inspect your equipment and notify the company of any defects. If you receive a citation for faulty equipment, you are responsible for paying the ticket.
<br><br><br>
<b>Overweight:</b>
<br><br><br>
It is the policy of the company to operate in a legal manner, unless we have ordered an overweight and/or oversize permit. You must weigh your load at the first convenient location and immediately report any overweight load. You will then be directed to report to your employer. If you fail to weigh your load and receive an overweight ticket, you/employer are responsible for the payment of that ticket. Empty Truck 100 will not be responsible for these charges.
<br><br><br>
<b>Fueling:</b>
<br><br><br>
All decisions regarding fuel will be made by employees' company/employer.
<b>Paperwork:</b>
All paperwork is between drivers, companies and owner, most of which may have a different requirements.
Although, this is the expect practice of your employer; EmptyTruck100 will be paid upon agreement of a Third Party Contact.
<br><br><br>
<b>Freight Claims:</b>
<br><br><br>
All claims must be made directly to your employer. Empty Truck 100 is in no way responsible for any loss or damage. If you are responsible for load and count, you will also be responsible for all shortages or damages. Check your load as it is going onto the truck and as it is coming off. If it is a sealed load or a SLC load, verify the unload count. Immediately call your employer dispatch if there are any damages or shortages. Do not sign for damages or shortages until you have talked to dispatch.
<br><br><br>

<b>Check Calls:</b>
<br><br><br>

Check calls should be made every day base on agreement with your employer, unless otherwise coordinated with dispatch or EmptyTruck100. In addition, if you are going to be late, or have any other Reroute problem, immediately call dispatch. Again, EmptyTruck100 is not involve in any decision making.

<br><br><br>

Remember to put out your triangles as necessary.
