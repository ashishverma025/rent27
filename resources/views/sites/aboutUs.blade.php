                    <p><em><u style="color:red;">Emptytruck100</u></em> is a family owned business. Global Warming is very much existent and we lose Arctic sea ice at a rate of almost 13% per decade. Trucks and cars collectively emit around 24 pounds of Carbon Dioxide and other greenhouse gases for every gallon of gas into the atmosphere. With this in mind, our business was started in 2015 with the intention of helping customers and drivers save the environment.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Why are there so many empty trucks on the streets?</p>
                        <ol>
                        <li>After delivering the goods, the trucks would have to return empty 95% of the time.</li>
                        <li>Majority of the time, trucks drive empty to pick up their merchandise for hundreds of miles.&nbsp;</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>How did I get the idea about EmptyTruck100?</p>
                        <p>After growing weary from living in the city of New York, I decided to move to Georgia in 2003. I paid a truck $2200.00 to move my furniture. The journey was approximately 900 miles and the drive was about 17.5 hours. We drove through <b style="color:red">Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North and South Carolina and Tennessee</b>. After dropping me off, the truck returned to New York empty. Years later, I began to brainstorm and try to formulate ways to solve this issue. I think that if there was a way for these trucks to advertise that they would be leaving from a certain place, on a certain day, at a specific time, the world would be a better place. The carbon emission would be decreased, drivers or companies would make extra cash and customer would pay half price to rent an empty truck. &nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>What is my goal?</p>
                        <p>Imagine that you are moving from New York to Georgia. You would have to rent a truck from New York to take you to Georgia, which would then drive back to New York empty. You would therefore have to pay for the truck to go back to New York. My goal is for you to hire a truck that came from Georgia on a previous trip and would be going back empty. Therefore, you would only pay half price.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>At the time I relocated to Georgia, it cost me $2200.00. I believe that if I did had the opportunity to use a website like <em style="color:red"><b>EmptyTruck100</b>, </em>I am sure I would only pay about $1000.00.</p>
