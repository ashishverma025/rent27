                   <p>Why is it so important to get verified? This will give our customers&nbsp;more&nbsp;confidence to use&nbsp;your drivers or company.&nbsp;Bob Marley said in one of his songs: &ldquo;Man to man is so unjust so you don&rsquo;t know who to trust. There is another saying you must not trust your own. So,&nbsp;it is important for us to let the customer have some form of confidence in doing business with you by getting verified.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Customers are not recommended to be verified.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>We only recommend drivers and companies to do so.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>So, with that said, if a driver or a company is on our site and they are verified you are still required to take precautions. Never let your guard down.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>We strongly recommend NOT to give out your bank or credit card detail to someone you never meet. Please be vigilant in any transaction you are doing.&nbsp;</p>
